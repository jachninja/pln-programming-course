# What is a variable

You can think of a variable as a box containing some data. If a variable in math can contain
any number, in a program, it can contain any number, a string, a collection of numbers,
or an object (more on that later)

## Syntax in Python

variable_name = some_value

The variable name must start with a letter or an underscore, and then can have any number
of letters, underscores and numbers.

## Examples
```
name = "Fulano DeTal"
xrdte987a98 = 10
_secret_code = "42"
```
